                        <h4>Personal Background</h4>
                        <p>I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.  I have little fear when aiming for towering goals. I might fail, but with God's help, my 'failure' (if you can call it that) will be better than most successes. Nonetheless, I pray for everyone's wellness üòâ.</p>
